1017    "IT'S BEEN 3 YEARS SINCE BONNIE INHERITED HER GRANDFATHER'S BOOKSTORE."
1018	"THIS WAS NO ORDINARY BOOKSTORE.\nBONNIE'S BOOKSTORE CARRIED NOTHING BUT THE FINEST BOOKS FOR CHILDREN."	
1019	"RUNNING A BOOKSTORE WAS FUN, BUT SOMETIMES, BONNIE DREAMED OF MAKING A BIGGER MARK ON THE WORLD."
1020	"ONE SPRING DAY, AS BONNIE\nWAS CLEANING THE ATTIC ABOVE THE STORE..."
1021	"WHAT’S THIS?\nHER GRANDFATHER KEPT A SMALL PAINTER'S GALLERY HIDDEN IN THE ATTIC!"
1022	"I'LL WRITE THE TEXT AND USE MY GRANDFATHER'S PAINTINGS TO MAKE CHILDREN'S BOOKS."
1023	"SURELY IT CAN'T BE TOO HARD TO PIECE TOGETHER A BIT OF TEXT TO ACCOMPANY THE PICTURES."
1024	"AND SO, AFTER WRITING 12 WONDERFUL CHILDREN'S BOOKS, BONNIE DECIDES TO TAKE A WELL-DESERVED BREAK..."
1025	"BUT THIS IS ONLY A PAUSE, NOT AN ENDING, AS BONNIE'S TALE HAS MANY EXCITING CHAPTERS AHEAD."

**Level-specific tutorial text
1103    "Pair Problems!\n\nBeware the many paired letters in this chapter.  Remember that you can use these in the beginning, middle, or end of a word."
1104	"On this level, all 'normal' letters that appear will be consonants.\n\nYou must use the fixed columns of vowels (plus wildcards) to form words and complete the puzzle."
1105	"On this level, you must play each tile TWICE to complete the puzzle."
1106	"Beware - on this level, Writer's Blocks are much more common, and can even be triggered by four letter words.\n\nPlay long words!"

**General tutorial text
1110	"Spell the word FROG by connecting F to R, then R to O, then O to G."
1111	"Enter your word by clicking the SUBMIT button!"
1112	"Good work!  Now spell the word CAKE by connecting letters!"
1113	"Click SUBMIT to complete your word (or just double-click on the last letter, E)."
1114	"Now find the word TALE.  Link the letters and submit it!"
1115	"Press SUBMIT to complete your word."
1116	"Good job!  Go ahead, make another word now.\n\nWords must be at least 3 letters long..."
1117	"Tiles turn GREEN when you use them.  Turn all tiles green to finish the chapter!"
1118	"Every time you play a word, you use up a turn.  Finish the chapter before you run out of turns!"
1119	"Keep an eye on the timer.  Finish the chapter before time runs out!"
1120	"Watch out, this is a Writer's Block!  Play the word SHOE underneath it to make it drop off the board."
1121	"Writer's Blocks can appear when you make 3 letter words.  Make longer words to avoid them!"
1122	"Longer words give you bonuses.\n\nFind a 5 letter word (such as XPLACEHOLDERX) for a special reward."  **Leave the word XPLACEHOLDERX untranslated as it is - it will be replaced with a list of eligible 5-letter words on the puzzle
1123	"This is a WILDCARD!\n\nYou earned it by making a 5+ letter word.  It can be used as any letter in a word."
1124	"If you can't find a good word, press SCRAMBLE to rearrange the letters."
1125	"Scrambling is handy, but be careful, it uses up one of your turns and adds a Writer's Block!"
1126	"Scrambling is handy, but be careful, it uses up time and adds a Writer's Block!"
1127	""
1128	"Great word!\n\nWhen you make a 7+ letter word, you get a special WILDCARD that you can keep re-using."
1129	"This is a COPYCAT!  You earned it by playing a word with the same letter appearing twice in a row.  COPYCATs always change to the last letter of the word you just played."
1130	"This is a CYCLER!  You earned it by playing a word where each letter comes alphabetically after the one before it (like BELT).   It starts as an 'A', then, if not played, becomes a 'B', 'C' and so on."
1131	"Because you've already got 2 permanent wildcards in play, you can't earn another - sorry!"
1132	"Scrambling is handy, but be careful, it uses up one of your turns."
1133	"Scrambling is handy, but be careful, it uses up time."
1134	"From this chapter on, using Scramble adds a Writer's Block to the puzzle."
1135	"Wow, you're doing a GREAT job on this level.\n\nHowever, you've reached the limit of extra turns (or time) you can earn on a single level.  You can earn more next level..."
1136	"This is a WILDCARD!  Sometimes you get them at the start of a level, but you can also earn one by playing a 5+ letter word."
1137	"This is a special WILDCARD that never disappears!  Sometimes you get them at the start of a level, but you can also earn one by playing a 7+ letter word"
1138	"This is a COPYCAT!  Sometimes you get them at the start of a level, but you can also earn one by playing a word with the same letter appearing twice in a row.  COPYCATs always change to the last letter of the word you just played."
1139	"This is a CYCLER!  Sometimes you get them at the start of a level, but you can also earn one by playing a word where each letter comes alphabetically after the one before it (like BELT).   It starts as an 'A', then, if not played, becomes a 'B', 'C' and so on."
1140	"Beware of LOCKS!\n\nYou can clear a lock by making a word adjacent to it."
1141	"Four of the tiles on this level are reversible.\n\nPlay them once and they turn green.\n\nPlay them again and they're back to yellow!"
1142	"The 4 colored letters on this level are permanent - they do not move or disappear."
