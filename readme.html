<p class="header"><a name="SR"><b>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</b> </a><a href="#top">[back
to top]</a></p>
<p>Bonnie's Bookstore Deluxe requires an PC with a 500 MHz or better processor. Your computer
must have at least 64 megabytes of RAM.</p>
<p>Operating System: you must be utilizing Windows 98, ME, 2000, or XP with DirectX 5 or later to play Bonnie's Bookstore Deluxe on your system. If you are using Windows Vista, please ensure that User Account Control (UAC) is activated. You must be logged in as an administrator to install this game. </p>
<p>Controls: a keyboard and mouse are required.</p>
<p>Sound: you must have a DirectX certified sound card installed.</p>
<p>Video: you must have your desktop set to 16-bit or 32-bit color mode (256 Colors may not work).</p>
<p class="header"><a name="HP"><b>HOW TO PLAY</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>
<p><a name="HP/MW"><b>Making Words</b></a></p>
<p>Form words 3 letters or longer.&nbsp; To form a word, click on a letter, then the next letter, the next, and so on, then click 'Submit'.&nbsp; Each letter (except the first) must be adjacent to the previous letter. Play in any direction - up, down, left, right, etc.</p>
<p>To submit words faster, just double click on the last letter, or 'drag and drop', by clicking on the first letter of your word, keep holding the left mouse button down, and drag the mouse through the letters, releasing on the last letter.</p>
<p>To cancel a word you've started to form, right-click, or click outside of the puzzle area.</p>
<p><a name="HP/WL"><b>Word Length</b></a></p>
<p>Avoid making too many 3-letter words - they cause &quot;Writer's Blocks&quot; to appear.</p>
<p>Forming a 5+ letter word gets you a wildcard tile that can be used as any letter.</p>
<p>Forming a 6+ letter word gets you extra time or turns.</p>
<p>Forming a 7+ letter word gets you a permanent wildcard that you can use repeatedly.</p>
<p>Word length is calculate by the number of letters used (not tiles), so a 2 letter tile (like 'Qu') counts as 2 letters.</p>
<p>(Note, these bonuses don't start appearing until the second chapter (i.e. level) of the game.</p>
<p><a name="HP/GO"><b>Game Objective</b></p>
<p>As you make words, the tiles you've used turn green.&nbsp; Turn all the tiles for a chapter green to finish it.&nbsp; When playing in 'Classic' mode, you have a limited number of turns to complete the chapter (each time you form a word, you use a turn).&nbsp; In 'Action' mode, you have a limited amount of time (but no turn limit).</p>
<p>Chapters are organized into books (4 or 5 chapters to a book).&nbsp; There are 12 books altogether (50 chapters).&nbsp; Complete them all to finish the story!</p>
<p>If you lose a chapter, you can start a new game on the chapter you were just on.&nbsp; The story will progress from that point - only your score will be reset to 0.&nbsp; You can also choose to start a new game from that point at a higher or lower difficulty level, and/or switch between Classic (turn-based) and Action (time-based) mode.</p>
<p><a name="HP/SC"><b>Scoring</b></p>
<p>In the first chapter, on normal difficulty, a 3 letter word is worth 10 points.&nbsp; That increases to 15 for chapter 2, 20 for chapter 3, etc., all the way up to 255 points for a 3 letter word on the last chapter of the last book (the 50th chapter overall).</p>
<p>For each letter longer than 3, the score doubles.&nbsp; So, on chapter 2, the scoring looks like this:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><font face="Courier">&nbsp;3 letters =&nbsp;&nbsp; 15 points</font></li>
<li><font face="Courier">&nbsp;4 letters =&nbsp;&nbsp; 30 points</font></li>
<li><font face="Courier">&nbsp;5 letters =&nbsp;&nbsp; 60 points</font></li>
<li><font face="Courier">&nbsp;6 letters =&nbsp;&nbsp; 90 points</font></li>
<li><font face="Courier">&nbsp;7 letters =&nbsp; 180 points</font></li>
<li><font face="Courier">&nbsp;8 letters =&nbsp; 360 points</font></li>
<li><font face="Courier">&nbsp;9 letters =&nbsp; 720 points</font></li>
<li><font face="Courier">10 letters = 1440 points</font></li>
</ul>
<p>When playing Hard difficulty, all point values are doubled.&nbsp; On Genius, all point values are quadrupled.&nbsp; The maximum you can score for a single word is 97,920 (10 letter word, 50th chapter, Genius difficulty).&nbsp; Don't worry - we've never scored that many points either!</p>
<p>When you complete a puzzle, unused turns are converted to points as if each turn was a 5 letter word.&nbsp; In Action Mode, time is converted to points as if each second was a 3 letter word.</p>
<p><a name="HP/DI"><b>Difficulty</b></a></p>
<a name="HP/DI">
<p>Higher difficulty levels award more points (see Scoring). but decrease the amount of turns (or time) you have to finish each chapter.&nbsp; That's the primary difference, though there are also other subtle differences in how quickly hints appear, how often Writer's Blocks appear, and so on...
<p><a name="HP/SCRAMBLE"><b>Scramble</b></p>
<p>The Scramble button scrambles (i.e. reshuffles) the letters of the puzzle.&nbsp; It also adds a Writer's Block, and it costs you one turn (or time, in Action Mode). .
<p><a name="HP/SPECIAL"><b>Special Tiles</b></p>
<p>Special tiles can be built into the design of a particular puzzle, or they can appear based on the words you form.&nbsp; Note that most special tiles will not appear until after you've completed from one to three puzzles (i.e. you won't see them on the first puzzle...).</p>
<p>The &quot;Writer's Block&quot; appears when you form multiple short (3-letter) words.&nbsp; It cannot be played through, and must be worked around.&nbsp; You can get rid of it by playing tiles underneath it, causing it to fall out of the bottom of the puzzle.</p>
<p>The &quot;CopyCat&quot; (looks white instead of black) appears when you play a word with the same letter appearing twice in a row (like 'BOOK' or 'DINNER').&nbsp; CopyCats always change to the last letter of the word you just played.</p>
<p>The &quot;Cycler&quot; (looks like a normal letter, but bounces around within its tile) appears when you play a word where each letter comes alphabetically after the one before it (like 'BELT' or 'DENT'). It starts as an 'A', then, if not played, becomes a 'B', 'C' and so on.</p>
<p class="header"><a name="TC"><b>TROUBLESHOOTING / COMPATIBILITY</b><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>
<p><a name="TC/VS"><b>Video / Sound Drivers</b></p>
<p>Bonnie's Bookstore Deluxe requires you to have DirectX 5 drivers or later installed. These are sound and video drivers from Microsoft used in many games.</p>
<p><a name="TC/SC"><b>Screen Color Depth</b></p>
<p>Bonnie's Bookstore Deluxe requires you to be running in 16-bit color or better. It may not function in properly in 256 colors. If you are running in 256 colors and experience difficulties running the game, try switching to 16 or 32 bit color.</p>
